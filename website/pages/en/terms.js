                    registered office at Ignition Law, Moray House, Floor 1, Moray House, 23-31 Great Titchfield Street, London,
                    United Kingdom, WC1W 7PA. We operate the website substrate.dev and any subdomains (including as identified
            below, as may change from time to time) (the &quot;</span><span><b>Site</b></span><span

                <p><span>These terms of use (together with the documents referred to in it) (the
            &quot;</span><span><b>Terms</b></span><span>&quot;) describe how you may access, browse, use
                    and interact with the Site. By using the Site you confirm that you accept these Terms and that you agree to
            comply with them. </span><span><u>If you do not agree to any part of these Terms, you must not
            use the Site.</u></span></p>
                <p><span>When certain words and phrases are used in these Terms, they have specific
                meanings (these are known as &quot;defined terms&quot;). You can identify these defined terms because they
                start with capital letters (even if they are not at the start of a sentence). Where a defined term is used,
                it has the meaning given to it in the section of these Terms where it was defined (you can find these
            meanings by looking at the sentence where the defined term is included in speech marks).</span></p>

                </ol>
                <p><span>You agree that any User Generated Content complies with those standards.</span></p>
                <p><span>If you are acting for purposes relating to your trade, business, craft or profession
            (a &quot;</span><span><b>Business User</b></span><span>&quot;), you will be liable to us and
            indemnify us for any losses, liabilities, damages, fines, penalties, expenses or costs (&quot;</span><span

                <p><span>We reserve the right to refuse or accept, remove, or refuse or cease to use any
                User Generated Content supplied by any person that we think contravenes these standards. We also have the
                right to disclose your identity to any third party who is claiming that any User Generated Content posted or
                uploaded by you to the Site constitutes a violation of their rights (including intellectual property rights
            or rights to privacy).</span></p>
                <p><span>You acknowledge, understand and agree that other users of the Site may upload or
                supply their own User Generated Content on the Site (in particular, though without limitation, users who
                submit pallets and tools to be made available on the Marketplace sub-domain). We are under no obligation to
                review, validate or correct any User Generated Content posted by you or by any other user of the Site
                (including pallet and tool submissions on the Marketplace sub-domain), and under no circumstances will be
                responsible or liable to you or any third party for the content or accuracy of any User Generated Content
                posted on the Site. We give no guarantee that any User Generated Content will be free from errors or

                <p><span><h3>Interactive Services</h3></span></p>
                <p><span>In addition, we may from time to time provide interactive services on the Site that
                shall enable you to upload User Generated Content, including, without limitation comment facilities, chat
            rooms and/or bulletin boards (together &quot;</span><span><b>Interactive Services</b></span><span
                    >&quot;).</span></p>
                <p><span>Where we provide an Interactive Service, we will use reasonable endeavours to
                provide information to you about the kind of service offered and if it is moderated. However, we are under
            no obligation to oversee, monitor or moderate any Interactive Service we provide.</span></p>
                <p><span>The use of any of our Interactive Services by a minor is subject to the consent of
                their parent or guardian. We advise parents who permit their children to use an Interactive Service that it
                is important that they communicate with their children about their safety online. Minors who are using any
            Interactive Service should be made aware of the potential risks to them.</span></p>

                are responsible for configuring your information technology, computer programmes and platform in order to
            access the Site. You should use your own virus protection software.</span></p>
                <p><span>You must not misuse the Site by knowingly introducing viruses, trojans, worms,
                logic bombs or other material which is malicious or technologically harmful. You must not attempt to gain
                unauthorised access to the Site, the server on which the Site is stored or any server, computer or database
                connected to the Site. You must not attack the Site via a denial-of-service attack or a distributed
                denial-of service attack. By breaching this provision, you would commit a criminal offence under the
                Computer Misuse Act 1990. We will report any such breach to the relevant law enforcement authorities and we
                will co-operate with those authorities by disclosing your identity to them. In the event of such a breach,
            your right to use the Site will cease immediately.</span></p>
                <p><span><h2>Intellectual property rights</h2></span></p>

                <p><span>If we fail to insist that you perform any of your obligations under these Terms,
                or if we do not enforce our rights against you, or if we delay in doing so, that will not mean that we have
                waived our rights against you and will not mean that you do not have to comply with those obligations. If we
                do waive a default by you, we will only do so in writing, and that will not mean that we will automatically
            waive any later default by you.</span></p>
