title: Introduction

In this tutorial, you will learn to compile and launch a pre-written Substrate chain, use that chain
as a cryptocurrency, and interact with it using a general-purpose Substrate user interface.

This tutorial is aimed at someone who has never touched Substrate before, and wants to get a
**basic** and **quick** understanding of what Substrate is all about. We will not be going into
depth about the intricacies of developing on Substrate, but will hopefully satisfy your curiosity so
that you will continue this journey.

This tutorial should take you about **1 hour** to complete. We will be compiling rust code, but you
do not need to be a rust programmer to complete this guide. We provide you with working code and
explain how to use it.

We only expect that:

- You are generally familiar with software development and using the terminal.
- You are generally familiar with blockchains and smart contract platforms.
- You are open to learning about the bleeding edge of blockchain development.

## What you will be doing

Before we even get started, let's lay out what we are going to do over the course of this tutorial.
We will:

1. Set up your computer to be able to develop on Substrate.
2. Use a template project to start running Substrate right away.
3. Use a general-purpose user interface to interact with our blockchain.
4. Transfer tokens between user accounts.

Sound reasonable? Good, then let's begin!
