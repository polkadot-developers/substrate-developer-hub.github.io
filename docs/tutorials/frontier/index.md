[Substrate](https://substrate.dev) is an extensible blockchain development framework. [Frontier](https://github.com/paritytech/frontier) is a set of modules to build an **Ethereum-compatible blockchain with Substrate**. 

This tutorial explains the concepts and demonstrates the steps necessary to build an Ethereum-compatible chain using Frontier.

## Before You Begin

You should have completed _at least_ the following three Substrate tutorials before attempting this workshop:

* [Create Your First Substrate Chain](../../tutorials/create-your-first-substrate-chain/)
* [Add a Pallet to Your Runtime](../../tutorials/add-a-pallet/)
* [Build a PoE Decentralized Application](../../tutorials/build-a-dapp/)

Before attempting this workshop, you should be familiar with most of the concepts listed below:

* Launching a Substrate chain
* Submitting extrinsics
* Adding, Removing, and configuring pallets in a runtime
* Ethereum and EVM basics
* Pallet design

Additional supplemental learning resources are recommended throughout the workshop.
