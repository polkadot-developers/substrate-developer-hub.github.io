title: Use the Sudo Pallet
---

As the name of the [Sudo pallet](../../knowledgebase/runtime/frame#sudo) implies, it provides
capabilities related to the management of a single
[`sudo` ("superuser do")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudo) administrator. In FRAME, the `Root`
Origin is used to identify the runtime administrator; some of FRAME's features, including the
ability to update the runtime by way of
[the `set_code` function](https://substrate.dev/rustdocs/v2.0.0/frame_system/enum.Call.html#variant.set_code),
are only accessible to this administrator. The Sudo pallet maintains a single
[storage item](../../knowledgebase/runtime/storage): the ID of the account that has access to the
pallet's [dispatchable functions](../../knowledgebase/getting-started/glossary#dispatch). The Sudo
pallet's `sudo` function allows the holder of this account to invoke a dispatchable as the `Root`
origin. The following pseudo-code demonstrates how this is achieved, refer to the
[Sudo pallet's source code](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/v2.0.0/frame/sudo/src/lib.rs)
to learn more.

```rust
fn sudo(origin, call) -> Result {
  // Ensure caller is the account identified by the administrator key
  let sender = ensure_signed(origin)?;
  ensure!(sender == Self::key(), Error::RequireSudo);

  // Dispatch the specified call as the Root origin
  let res = call.dispatch(Origin::Root);
  Ok()
}
```

## Start the Template Node

Since forkless runtime upgrades do not require network participants to restart their blockchain
clients, the first step of this tutorial is to start the template node as-is. Build and start the
unmodified [Node Template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template). The
node will not be restarted as part of this tutorial despite the fact that two runtime upgrades are
performed.

```shell
cargo run -- --dev --tmp
```

Notice that the [well-known Alice account](../../knowledgebase/integrate/subkey#well-known-keys) is
configured as the holder of the Sudo pallet's key in the `development_config` function of the
template node's
[chain specification file](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template/blob/master/node/src/chain_spec.rs) -
this is the configuration that is used when the node is launched with the `--dev` flag. That means
that Alice's account will be the one used to perform runtime upgrades throughout this tutorial.

## Runtime Upgrade Resource Accounting

Dispatchable calls in Substrate are always associated with a
[weight](../../knowledgebase/learn-substrate/weight), which is used for resource accounting. FRAME's
System module enforces a
[`MaximumExtrinsicWeight`](https://substrate.dev/rustdocs/v2.0.0/frame_system/trait.Trait.html#associatedtype.MaximumExtrinsicWeight)
and a
[`MaximumBlockWeight`](https://substrate.dev/rustdocs/v2.0.0/frame_system/trait.Trait.html#associatedtype.MaximumBlockWeight).
The `set_code` function in
[the System module](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/v2.0.0/frame/system/src/lib.rs) is
intentionally designed to consume the maximum weight that may fit in a block. The `set_code`
function's weight annotation also specifies that `set_code` is in
[the `Operational` class](../../knowledgebase/runtime/fees#operational-dispatches) of dispatchable
functions, which identifies it as relating to network _operations_ and impacts the accounting of its
resources, such as by exempting it from the
[`TransactionByteFee`](https://substrate.dev/rustdocs/v2.0.0/pallet_transaction_payment/trait.Trait.html#associatedtype.TransactionByteFee).
In order to work within FRAME's safeguards around resource accounting, the Sudo pallet provides the
[`sudo_unchecked_weight`](https://substrate.dev/rustdocs/v2.0.0/pallet_sudo/enum.Call.html#variant.sudo_unchecked_weight)
function, which provides the same capability as the `sudo` function, but accepts an additional
parameter that is used to specify the (possibly zero) weight to use for the call. The
`sudo_unchecked_weight` function is what will be used to invoke the runtime upgrade in this section
of this tutorial; in the next section, the Scheduler pallet will be used to manage the resources
consumed by the `set_code` function.

## Prepare an Upgraded Runtime

Because the template node doesn't come with the Scheduler pallet included in its runtime, the first
runtime upgrade performed in this tutorial will add that pallet. First, add the Scheduler pallet as
a dependency in the template node's `runtime/Cargo.toml` file.

```toml
pallet-scheduler = { default-features = false, version = '2.0.0' }

#--snip--

[features]
default = ['std']
std = [
    #--snip--
    'pallet-scheduler/std',
    #--snip--
]
```

Next, add the pallet to the runtime by updating `runtime/src/lib.rs`.

```rust
// Define the types required by the Scheduler pallet.
parameter_types! {
	pub MaximumSchedulerWeight: Weight = Perbill::from_percent(80) * MaximumBlockWeight::get();
	pub const MaxScheduledPerBlock: u32 = 50;
}

// Configure the runtime's implementation of the Scheduler pallet.
impl pallet_scheduler::Trait for Runtime {
	type Event = Event;
	type Origin = Origin;
	type PalletsOrigin = OriginCaller;
	type Call = Call;
	type MaximumWeight = MaximumSchedulerWeight;
	type ScheduleOrigin = frame_system::EnsureRoot<AccountId>;
	type MaxScheduledPerBlock = MaxScheduledPerBlock;
	type WeightInfo = ();
}

// Add the Scheduler pallet inside the construct_runtime! macro.
construct_runtime!(
	pub enum Runtime where
		Block = Block,
		NodeBlock = opaque::Block,
		UncheckedExtrinsic = UncheckedExtrinsic
	{
		/*** snip ***/
		Scheduler: pallet_scheduler::{Module, Call, Storage, Event<T>},
	}
);
```

The final step to preparing an upgraded FRAME runtime is to increment its
[`spec_version`](https://substrate.dev/rustdocs/v2.0.0/sp_version/struct.RuntimeVersion.html#structfield.spec_version),
which is a member of
[the `RuntimeVersion` struct](https://substrate.dev/rustdocs/v2.0.0/sp_version/struct.RuntimeVersion.html)
that is defined in `runtime/src/lib.rs`.

```rust
pub const VERSION: RuntimeVersion = RuntimeVersion {
	spec_name: create_runtime_str!("node-template"),
	impl_name: create_runtime_str!("node-template"),
	authoring_version: 1,
	spec_version: 2,  // Update this value.
	impl_version: 1,
	apis: RUNTIME_API_VERSIONS,
	transaction_version: 1,
};
```

Take a moment to review the components of the `RuntimeVersion` struct:

- `spec_name`: The name of the runtime/chain, e.g. Ethereum.
- `impl_name`: The name of the client, e.g. OpenEthereum.
- `authoring_version`: The authorship version for
  [block authors](../../knowledgebase/getting-started/glossary#author).
- `spec_version`: The version of the runtime/chain.
- `impl_version`: The version of the client.
- `apis`: The list of supported APIs.
- `transaction_version`: The version of the
  [dispatchable function](../../knowledgebase/getting-started/glossary#dispatch) interface.

In order to upgrade the runtime it is _required_ to _increase_ the `spec_version`; refer to the
implementation of the
[FRAME System](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/v2.0.0/frame/system/src/lib.rs) module
and in particular the `can_set_code` function to to see how this requirement and others are enforced
by runtime logic.

Build the upgraded runtime.

```shell
cargo build --release -p node-template-runtime
```

Notice that the `--release` flag has been added to the `cargo build` command; although this will
result in a longer compile time, it will generate a smaller build artifact that is better suited for
submitting to the blockchain network. Aside from this use case, the `--release` flag should be used
any time you are preparing a binary for use in production, as it will result in an optimized
executable application. When the `--release` flag is specified, build artifacts are output to the
`target/release` directory; when the flag is omitted they will be sent to `target/debug`. Refer to
[the official documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-build.html) to learn
more about building Rust code with Cargo.

## Upgrade the Runtime

Use this link to open the Polkadot JS Apps UI and automatically configure the UI to connect to the
local node: https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/extrinsics?rpc=ws://127.0.0.1:9944. Use Alice's account
to invoke the `sudoUncheckedWeight` function and use the `setCode` function from the system
pallet as its parameter. In order to supply the build artifact that was generated by the previous
build step, toggle the "file upload" switch on the right-hand side of the "code" input field for the
parameter to the `setCode` function. Click the "code" input field, and select the Wasm binary that
defines the upgraded runtime:
`target/release/wbuild/node-template-runtime/node_template_runtime.compact.wasm`. Leave the value
for the `_weight` parameter at the default of `0`. Click "Submit Transaction" and then "Sign and
Submit".

After the transaction has been included in a block, the version number in the upper-left-hand corner
of Polkadot JS Apps UI should reflect that the runtime version is now `2`.
