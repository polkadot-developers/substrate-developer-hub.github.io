title: Schedule an Upgrade
---

Now that the Node Template has been upgraded to include the Scheduler pallet,
[the `schedule` function](https://substrate.dev/rustdocs/latest/pallet_scheduler/pallet/enum.Call.html#variant.schedule)
can be used to perform the next runtime upgrade. In the previous section, the
`sudo_unchecked_weight` function was used to override the weight associated with the `set_code`
function; in this section, the runtime upgrade will be _scheduled_ so that it can be processed as
the only [extrinsic](../../knowledgebase/learn-substrate/extrinsics) in a block.

## Prepare an Upgraded Runtime

This upgrade is more straightforward than the previous one and only requires updating a single value
in `runtime/src/lib.rs` aside from the runtime's `spec_version`.

```rust
pub const VERSION: RuntimeVersion = RuntimeVersion {
  spec_name: create_runtime_str!("node-template"),
  impl_name: create_runtime_str!("node-template"),
  authoring_version: 1,
  spec_version: 102,  // *Increment* this value.
  impl_version: 1,
  apis: RUNTIME_API_VERSIONS,
  transaction_version: 1,
};

/*** snip ***/

parameter_types! {
  pub const ExistentialDeposit: u128 = 1000;  // Update this value.
  pub const MaxLocks: u32 = 50;
}

/*** snip ***/

```

This change increases the value of the Balances pallet's
[`ExistentialDeposit`](../../knowledgebase/getting-started/glossary#existential-deposit) - the
minimum balance needed to keep an account alive from the point-of-view of the Balances pallet.

> Keep in mind that this change will _not_ cause all accounts with balances between 500 and 1000
> to be reaped - that would require a
> [storage migration](../../knowledgebase/runtime/upgrades#storage-migrations), which is out of
> scope for this tutorial.

### Build the Upgraded Runtime

```bash
cargo build --release -p node-template-runtime
```

> This will _override_ any privous build artifacts! So if you want to have a copy on hand of
> your last runtime Wasm build files, be sure to copy them somewhere else.

## Upgrade the Runtime

In the previous section, the Scheduler pallet was configured with the `Root` origin as its
[`ScheduleOrigin`](https://substrate.dev/rustdocs/latest/pallet_scheduler/trait.Config.html#associatedtype.ScheduleOrigin),
which means that the `sudo` function (_not_ `sudo_unchecked_weight`) can be used to invoke the
`schedule` function. To upgrade the runtime:

- Use [this link](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/sudo?rpc=ws://127.0.0.1:9944) to open the Polkadot JS Apps UI's Sudo
   tab. Refresh your browser if you have it already running to make sure that the
Extrinsics for the Scheduler pallet show. 
- Wait until all the other fields
have been filled in before providing the `when` parameter. 
- Leave the `maybe_periodic` parameter
empty and the `priority` parameter at its default value of `0`. 
- Select the System pallet's
`set_code` function as the `call` parameter and provide the Wasm binary as before.
- Leave the
"with weight override" option deactivated. 

Once all the other fields have been filled in, use a
block number about 10 blocks (1 minute) in the future to fill in the `when` parameter and quickly
submit the transaction.

You can use the template node's command line output or the
[Polkadot JS Apps UI block explorer](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer?rpc=ws://127.0.0.1:9944)
to watch as this scheuled call takes place.

![Scheduled Success Runtime Upgrade Version 102](assets/tutorials/forkless-upgrade/scheduled-upgrade-success.png)

After the target block has been included in the chain, the version number in the upper-left-hand
corner of Polkadot JS Apps UI should reflect that the runtime version is now `102`.

You can then observe the specific changes that were made in the upgrade by using the
[Polkadot JS Apps UI Chain State](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/chainstate/constants?rpc=ws://127.0.0.1:9944)
app to query the `existentialDeposit` constant value from the Balances pallet. (You may again need
to refresh the page)
