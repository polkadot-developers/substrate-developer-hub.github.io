title: Client Libraries
---

There are a number of language-specific client libraries that can be used to interact with
Substrate-based blockchains. In general, the capabilities that these libraries expose are
implemented on top of the Substrate remote procedure call (RPC) API.

## Javascript

The Polkadot JS team maintains a rich set of tools for interacting with Substrate-based blockchains.
Refer to [the main Polkadot JS page](./polkadot-js) to learn more about that suite of tools.

Parity also maintains [`txwrapper`](https://github.com/paritytech/txwrapper), which is a Javascript
library for offline generation of Substrate transactions.

## Go

[The Go Substrate RPC Client](https://github.com/centrifuge/go-substrate-rpc-client/), AKA GSRPC, is
maintained by [Centrifuge](https://centrifuge.io/).

## C

[Polkadot API DotNet](https://github.com/usetech-llc/polkadot_api_dotnet) is a Substrate RPC client
library for .Net programmers. It is maintained by [Usetech](https://usetech.com/blockchain/).

## C++

[Usetech](https://usetech.com/blockchain/) also maintains Polkadot API CPP, which is a C++ library
for interacting with the Substrate RPC.

## Rust

Parity maintains [`substrate-subxt`](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-subxt), which is a Rust
library specifically designed for submitting extrinsics to Substrate blockchains. The
[the Substrate API Client](https://github.com/scs/substrate-api-client) is another Substrate client
library for Rust that is maintained by Supercomputing Systems; its API is more general-purpose than
`substrate-subxt`.
