title: Session Keys
---

Session keys are "hot keys" that are used by validators to sign consensus-related messages. They are
not meant to be used as account keys that control funds and should only be used for their intended
purpose. They can be changed regularly; your Controller only needs to create a certificate by
signing a session public key and broadcasting this certificate via an extrinsic. Session keys are also
defined generically and made concrete in the runtime.

To create a Session key, validator operators must attest that a key acts on behalf of their Stash
account (stake) and nominators. To do so, they create a certificate by signing the key with their
Controller key. Then, they inform the chain that this key represents their Controller key by
publishing the Session certificate in a transaction on the chain.

Substrate provides the
[Session pallet](https://substrate.dev/rustdocs/latest/pallet_session/index.html), which allows
validators to manage their session keys.

## Use

Session keys are used by validators to sign consensus-related messages. [`SessionKeys`](https://substrate.dev/rustdocs/latest/sp_session/trait.SessionKeys.html) is a generic,
indexable type that is made concrete in the runtime.

You can declare any number of Session keys. For example, the default Substrate node uses four. Other
chains could have more or fewer depending on what operations the chain expects its validators to
perform.

In practice, validators amalgamate all of the session public keys into a single object, sign the set
of public keys with a "Controller" account, and submit a transaction to register the keys on chain.
This on-chain registration links a validator _node_ with an _account_ that holds funds. As such,
that account can be credited with rewards or slashed based on the node's behavior.

The runtime declares what session keys will be included (`runtime/src/lib.rs`):

```rust
impl_opaque_keys! {
    pub struct SessionKeys {
        pub grandpa: Grandpa,
        pub babe: Babe,
        pub im_online: ImOnline,
        pub authority_discovery: AuthorityDiscovery,
    }
}
```

The actual cryptographic curve that each key uses gets defined in `primitives`. For example, BABE's
key uses sr25519:

```rust
mod app {
	  use sp_application_crypto::{app_crypto, key_types::BABE, sr25519};
	  app_crypto!(sr25519, BABE);
}
```

> This code is just an example of a Substrate node at the
> [time of writing](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template).
> Refer to the runtime for the most up-to-date implementation.

The default Substrate node implements Session keys in the
[Session pallet](https://substrate.dev/rustdocs/latest/pallet_session/).

### Strongly Typed Wrappers

The Session keys from a Substrate node could use the same cryptography, but serve *very* different purposes
in your runtime logic. To prevent the wrong key being used for the wrong operation, strong
Rust types wrap these keys, keeping them incompatible with one another and ensuring they are only
used for their intended purpose.

## Generation

As a node operator, you can generate keys using the RPC call
[`author_rotateKeys`](https://substrate.dev/rustdocs/latest/sc_rpc/author/trait.AuthorApi.html#tymethod.rotate_keys).
You will then need to register the new keys on chain using a [`session.setKeys`](https://substrate.dev/rustdocs/latest/pallet_session/struct.Module.html#method.set_keys) transaction.

> **Note:** for increased security, session keys should be changed every session. This can be done by creating a certificate via signing a session public key
> and broadcasting it via an extrinsic.

Since session keys are hot keys that must be kept online, the individual keys should **not** be used to
control funds. All the logic for handling session keys is in the Substrate client, primitives, and
Session pallet. If one of the Session keys is compromised, the attacker could commit slashable
behavior.
